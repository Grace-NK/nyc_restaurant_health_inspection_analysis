Project Overview: Analyzing NYC Food Safety 
This project uses public data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to perform a comprehensive analysis of restaurant health inspection performance and public safety risk.

The primary goal is to identify systemic failure points including geographic, cuisine, and temporal hotspots to provide actionable recommendations for targeted inspections and public health policy adjustments.

Key Objectives:
Data Cleaning & Preparation: Utilize SQL (MySQL) to clean a large, messy dataset, including handling duplicates, missing values, and data type inconsistencies.

Risk Quantification: Calculate key performance metrics such as Average Inspection Score and Total Critical Violations across all NYC boroughs and ZIP codes.

Geographic Visualization: Create a Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard in Power BI to map the risk across the city, visually highlighting high-risk areas based on the severity and volume of violations.

Policy Recommendations: Answer critical questions about which violations and cuisines pose the greatest public health threat.

Tools Used: SQL (MySQL), Power BI.
